    "**Final exercise (advanced)**:*The MNF bands computed for the hyperspectral image are not comparable with the ones computed for the hypercloud, as this statistical approach generates the bands using a different combination of weights. Can you compute an MNF transform on the image data, and then apply it to the hypercloud dataset? Note that: (1) the MNF function returns the linear weights list (`w`) that were used to map the hyperspectral data onto each MNF bands; (2) specific bands can be extracted from the image dataset such that it has matching wavelengths (and number of bands) to the hypercloud dataset using `foo.export_bands(...)`. How comparable do you think the outputs are? Can you revise your guess as to where each of the samples came from?*\n"
